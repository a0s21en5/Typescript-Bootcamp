# Core Data Types in TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that introduces type annotations to variables. Understanding the core data types is crucial for effectively defining variables and functions in TypeScript.

## Number

The `number` type in TypeScript represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Unlike some other programming languages, TypeScript treats all numbers as floating-point values.

```typescript
let age: number = 30;
let pi: number = 3.14;
```

## String

The string type represents a sequence of characters, typically used for textual data. Strings can be enclosed in either double (") or single (') quotes.

```typescript
let name: string = "John Doe";
let message: string = 'Hello, TypeScript!';

```

## Boolean

The boolean type in TypeScript represents a logical value indicating true or false. It's commonly used in conditional statements and boolean expressions.

```typescript
let isActive: boolean = true;
let isEnabled: boolean = false;
```

For more advanced scenarios, TypeScript also supports other data types such as arrays, tuples, enums, any, void, null, and undefined.
