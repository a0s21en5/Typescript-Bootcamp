# Object Type in typescript

Type inference in TypeScript allows the compiler to automatically deduce the types of variables and expressions based on their initial values. This helps reduce the need for explicit type annotations, enhancing code clarity and conciseness while maintaining type safety.

For example, when you initialize a variable with a number, TypeScript infers that the variable is of type number. Similarly, if you initialize it with a string, TypeScript infers string as the type.
