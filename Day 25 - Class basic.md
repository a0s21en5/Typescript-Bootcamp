# Class in TypeScript

## What is a Class?

In TypeScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods. It serves as a template that defines the data and behavior common to any object of a certain type. Classes encapsulate data (in the form of properties) and behavior (in the form of methods), allowing for code reuse, modularity, and better organization in applications.

**Key Features of Classes:**

- **Properties:** Variables that hold data related to the object.
- **Methods:** Functions that perform actions related to the object.
- **Constructor:** Special method used for initializing objects when they are created.
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling of data (properties) and methods that operate on the data, protecting it from outside interference and misuse.

Classes in TypeScript facilitate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. They provide a structured way to represent real-world entities and enable developers to build complex systems more efficiently.
